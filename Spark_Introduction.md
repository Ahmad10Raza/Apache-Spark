# Introduction To Spark

Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system that provides a fast and general-purpose cluster-computing framework for big data processing and analytics. It was developed to address the limitations of the MapReduce computing model, offering improvements in speed, ease of use, and versatility.

Key features of Apache Spark include:

1. **Speed:** Spark is designed for speed, providing in-memory computing capabilities that enable it to process data much faster than the traditional disk-based processing of MapReduce.
2. **Ease of Use:** Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, making it accessible to a wide range of developers with different programming language preferences. It also includes built-in libraries for diverse tasks such as SQL queries, machine learning, graph processing, and streaming.
3. **Generality:** Spark is a general-purpose framework that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It supports batch processing, interactive queries, streaming analytics, machine learning, and graph processing, making it a versatile choice for big data applications.
4. **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs):** RDDs are the fundamental data structure in Spark. They are fault-tolerant collections of objects that can be processed in parallel. RDDs enable Spark to efficiently handle large-scale data processing tasks.
5. **Cluster Computing:** Spark can distribute data across a cluster of machines and perform parallel processing, enabling it to scale horizontally and handle large datasets.
6. **Fault Tolerance:** Spark provides fault tolerance through lineage information stored for each RDD. In case of a node failure, Spark can recompute lost data using this lineage information.
7. **Extensibility:** Spark is extensible, allowing developers to write custom modules and libraries to extend its functionality. This extensibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Overall, Apache Spark is a powerful and flexible framework that has gained popularity in the big data processing ecosystem due to its speed, ease of use, and versatility.

# How Spark Work With Big Data?

Apache Spark is designed to work efficiently with big data by leveraging distributed computing across a cluster of machines. Here's a high-level overview of how Spark handles big data:

1. **Distributed Computing Model:**

   - Spark distributes data processing tasks across a cluster of nodes, enabling parallel processing. Each node in the cluster performs computations on a subset of the data.
2. **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs):**

   - RDD is the fundamental data structure in Spark. It represents an immutable distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel. RDDs are divided into partitions, and each partition can be processed on a separate node in the cluster.
3. **Data Storage:**

   - Spark can efficiently store data in-memory, reducing the need for repetitive disk I/O operations. This in-memory processing capability contributes to Spark's speed and efficiency.
4. **Lazy Evaluation:**

   - Spark uses lazy evaluation, meaning that it delays the execution of operations until the result is actually needed. This allows Spark to optimize the execution plan and minimize unnecessary computations.
5. **Transformations and Actions:**

   - Spark provides two types of operations: transformations and actions. Transformations create a new RDD from an existing one, while actions return a value to the driver program or write data to an external storage system. Transformations are lazily evaluated, and actions trigger the execution of the computation.
6. **Fault Tolerance:**

   - Spark ensures fault tolerance through lineage information stored for each RDD. If a partition is lost due to node failure, Spark can recompute the lost data using the lineage information. This resilience is crucial for handling large-scale data processing tasks.
7. **Cluster Manager Integration:**

   - Spark can integrate with various cluster managers, such as Apache Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, or its standalone cluster manager. These managers are responsible for allocating resources and managing the execution of Spark applications across the cluster.
8. **Built-in Libraries:**

   - Spark provides built-in libraries for various tasks, such as Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for real-time data processing. These libraries enable developers to perform complex data processing tasks without building everything from scratch.
9. **Extensibility:**

   - Spark is extensible, allowing developers to write custom modules and libraries to extend its functionality. This extensibility makes it adaptable to a wide range of big data processing requirements.

By combining these features, Apache Spark efficiently distributes and processes large volumes of data across a cluster, making it well-suited for big data analytics and processing tasks.


## Is Spark realy store data?

You're right; I may have caused some confusion. Let me clarify: Apache Spark itself doesn't store data persistently. Instead, it relies on external storage systems for data persistence. Spark processes data in-memory during the computation, but it doesn't serve as a persistent storage system.

The data processed by Spark can come from various sources like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache HBase, Apache Hive, Amazon S3, and more. After processing, the results can be written back to these external storage systems or other supported data sources.

So, while Spark doesn't store data, it seamlessly integrates with distributed storage systems to read and write data during the processing pipeline.


# Monolithic V/s Distributed Approach

**Monolithic Architecture:**

- In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is designed and structured as a single, indivisible unit.
- All components of the application, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are tightly integrated and run within the same process or instance.
- Scaling a monolithic application typically involves vertical scaling, where you increase the resources (CPU, RAM) of the single server.

**Distributed Architecture:**

- In a distributed architecture, the application is designed to run on multiple machines or nodes that work together to achieve a common goal.
- Different components of the application can be distributed across various nodes, often communicating over a network.
- Scaling in a distributed system involves horizontal scaling, where additional nodes are added to the system to handle increased load.

**Differences:**

1. **Structure:**

   - *Monolithic:* Single, tightly integrated unit.
   - *Distributed:* Spread across multiple machines or nodes.
2. **Integration:**

   - *Monolithic:* Components are tightly coupled.
   - *Distributed:* Components can be loosely coupled and communicate over a network.
3. **Scalability:**

   - *Monolithic:* Typically involves vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server).
   - *Distributed:* Involves horizontal scaling (adding more machines or nodes to the system).
4. **Fault Tolerance:**

   - *Monolithic:* Limited fault tolerance. A failure in one component can affect the entire system.
   - *Distributed:* Higher fault tolerance. If one node fails, others can continue to operate.
5. **Development and Deployment:**

   - *Monolithic:* Centralized development and deployment. Updates may require downtime for the entire application.
   - *Distributed:* Can be more modular in development. Updates to specific components can be done independently, reducing downtime.

In summary, a monolithic architecture is a single, tightly integrated unit, while a distributed architecture involves multiple components spread across different machines, communicating over a network. The key distinctions lie in their structure, integration, scalability, fault tolerance, and development/deployment processes.
